## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learned how to center a div container using CSS properties.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.content {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%)
}


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I want to improve on my CSS styling and responsive layout 



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://blog.hubspot.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to position a container in the center. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
